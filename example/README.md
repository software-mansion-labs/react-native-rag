## Notes

- This example uses [React Native ExecuTorch](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-executorch) to run LLMs and Text Embeddings locally. Make sure you have enough RAM available on your device, simulator/emulator to run the models. Checkout [Memory Usage Benchmarks](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-executorch/docs/benchmarks/memory-usage#llms).
