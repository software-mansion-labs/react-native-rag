# `@react-native-rag/op-sqlite`

This package provides a `VectorStore` implementation that uses `op-sqlite` for persistent storage of vector embeddings in a React Native application. It's designed to be used with the `react-native-rag` library.

## Features

  * **Persistent Storage**: Your vector data is saved on the device, so it's available across app launches.
  * **Efficient Similarity Search**: Leverages the vector search capabilities of `op-sqlite` for fast and accurate retrieval.
  * **Seamless Integration**: Designed to work as a drop-in replacement for other `VectorStore` implementations in `react-native-rag`.

## Installation

First, install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install @react-native-rag/op-sqlite @op-engineering/op-sqlite
```

You also need to follow the installation instructions for `@op-engineering/op-sqlite`.

## Configuration

To enable the required features for vector search, you must add the following configuration to your `package.json` file:

```json
"op-sqlite": {
  "libsql": true,
  "sqliteVec": true
}
```

This configuration ensures that the necessary `libsql` and `sqliteVec` extensions are enabled for `op-sqlite`.

## Usage

To use `OPSQLiteVectorStore`, you need to instantiate it with an `Embeddings` implementation. Here's how you can use it with the `useRAG` hook from `react-native-rag`:

```typescript
import { useRAG } from 'react-native-rag';
import { OPSQLiteVectorStore } from '@react-native-rag/op-sqlite';
import { YourLLM, YourEmbeddings } from './your-implementations'; // Provide your own LLM and Embeddings

const App = () => {
  const { isReady, generate, addDocument } = useRAG({
    llm: new YourLLM(),
    vectorStore: new OPSQLiteVectorStore({
      name: 'my-vector-db',
      embeddings: new YourEmbeddings(),
    }),
  });

  // ... your component logic
};
```

## API Reference

### `OPSQLiteVectorStore`

#### `constructor(params: OPSQLiteVectorStoreParams)`

Initializes a new instance of the vector store.

  * `params.name`: The name for the SQLite database file (e.g., `'my-vectors.db'`).
  * `params.embeddings`: An instance of a class that implements the `Embeddings` interface, used to convert documents into numerical vectors.

#### Methods

The `OPSQLiteVectorStore` class implements the `VectorStore` interface from `react-native-rag`.

  * #### `load(): Promise<this>`

    Initializes the vector store by preparing the database. It creates the necessary `vectors` table with a specialized index for efficient similarity searching. This asynchronous method should be called once before performing any other operations.

  * #### `unload(): Promise<void>`

    Releases any resources used by the vector store. This will call `unload` on the associated `Embeddings` instance and close the SQLite database connection. Use this to free resources when the vector store is no longer needed.

  * #### `add(document: string, metadata?: object): Promise<string>`

    Adds a new document to the store. It generates a vector embedding from the document's content and saves the document, its embedding, and any optional metadata.

      * **Returns**: A `Promise` that resolves with the unique ID (`uuid`) of the newly added document.

  * #### `update(id: string, document?: string, metadata?: object): Promise<void>`

    Modifies an existing document identified by its ID. You can update the document's text content, its metadata, or both. If the document content is changed, a new vector embedding will be automatically generated and stored.

      * **Throws**: An error if the document with the specified `id` does not exist.

  * #### `delete(id: string): Promise<void>`

    Removes a document and its corresponding vector from the store using its unique ID.

      * **Throws**: An error if the document with the specified `id` does not exist.

  * #### `similaritySearch(query: string, k?: number): Promise<object[]>`

    Finds the most relevant documents in the store based on a query string. It generates an embedding for the query and returns the top `k` documents that are most similar.

      * `query`: The text to search for.
      * `k`: The number of similar documents to return. Defaults to `3`.
      * **Returns**: A `Promise` that resolves with an array of result objects, each containing `{ id, content, metadata, similarity }`. The `similarity` score ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 means a perfect match.

  * #### `deleteVectorStore(): Promise<void>`

    A utility method to completely delete the vector table from the database. This will erase all stored documents and embeddings. Use with caution.
