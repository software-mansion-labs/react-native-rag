# `@react-native-rag/op-sqlite`

This package provides a `VectorStore` implementation that uses `op-sqlite` for persistent storage of vector embeddings in a React Native application. It's designed to be used with the `react-native-rag` library.

## Features

  * **Persistent Storage**: Your vector data is saved on the device, so it's available across app launches.
  * **Efficient Similarity Search**: Leverages the vector search capabilities of `op-sqlite` for fast and accurate retrieval.
  * **Seamless Integration**: Designed to work as a drop-in replacement for other `VectorStore` implementations in `react-native-rag`.

## Installation

First, install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install @react-native-rag/op-sqlite @op-engineering/op-sqlite
```

You also need to follow the installation instructions for `@op-engineering/op-sqlite`.

## Configuration

To enable the required features for vector search, you must add the following configuration to your `package.json` file:

```json
"op-sqlite": {
  "libsql": true,
  "sqliteVec": true
}
```

This configuration ensures that the necessary `libsql` and `sqliteVec` extensions are enabled for `op-sqlite`.

## Usage

To use `OPSQLiteVectorStore`, you need to instantiate it with an `Embeddings` implementation. Here's how you can use it with the `useRAG` hook from `react-native-rag`:

```typescript
import { useRAG } from 'react-native-rag';
import { OPSQLiteVectorStore } from '@react-native-rag/op-sqlite';
import { YourLLM, YourEmbeddings } from './your-implementations'; // Provide your own LLM and Embeddings

const App = () => {
  const { isReady, generate, addDocument } = useRAG({
    llm: new YourLLM(),
    vectorStore: new OPSQLiteVectorStore({
      name: 'my-vector-db',
      embeddings: new YourEmbeddings(),
    }),
  });

  // ... your component logic
};
```
