# `@react-native-rag/executorch`

This package provides implementations for the `Embeddings` and `LLM` interfaces from `react-native-rag`, using `react-native-executorch` to run AI models on-device. This enables you to perform inference directly on the user's device, ensuring privacy and offline capabilities.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @react-native-rag/executorch react-native-executorch
```

## Usage

### `ExecuTorchEmbeddings`

This class allows you to use an ExecuTorch-compatible model to generate text embeddings.

```typescript
import { ALL_MINILM_L6_V2, ALL_MINILM_L6_V2_TOKENIZER } from 'react-native-executorch';
import { ExecuTorchEmbeddings } from '@react-native-rag/executorch';

const embeddings = new ExecuTorchEmbeddings({
  modelSource: ALL_MINILM_L6_V2,
  tokenizerSource: ALL_MINILM_L6_V2_TOKENIZER,
});
```

### `ExecuTorchLLM`

This class allows you to use an ExecuTorch-compatible language model for text generation.

```typescript
import {
  LLAMA3_2_1B,
  LLAMA3_2_TOKENIZER,
  LLAMA3_2_TOKENIZER_CONFIG,
} from 'react-native-executorch';
import { ExecuTorchLLM } from '@react-native-rag/executorch';

const llm = new ExecuTorchLLM({
  modelSource: LLAMA3_2_1B,
  tokenizerSource: LLAMA3_2_TOKENIZER,
  tokenizerConfigSource: LLAMA3_2_TOKENIZER_CONFIG,
});
```

### Integration with `react-native-rag`

You can use these classes directly with the `useRAG` hook:

```typescript
import { useRAG } from 'react-native-rag';
import { ExecuTorchLLM, ExecuTorchEmbeddings } from '@react-native-rag/executorch';
import { MemoryVectorStore } from 'react-native-rag';

const App = () => {
  const { isReady, generate } = useRAG({
    llm,
    vectorStore: new MemoryVectorStore({ embeddings }),
  });

  // ... your component logic
};
```
